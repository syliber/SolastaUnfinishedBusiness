PALACE OF ICE FAQ:

1. Do Inventors get a customized chest on POI? Yes.
2. How can I import a campaign if "saves by location" is enabled? First select the location on the Load Game UI.
3. How can I import heroes above level 12? Enable bypass min/max levels under Gameplay > Tools
4. Why I cannot load any save with UB Gnomes or Tieflings? You have to acquire the POI DLC from now on to use them.
5. Why I cannot find a hero or save file? You missed RESPEC alerts in the changelog... Changelog?!? Yea, I know.
6. Why this mod sucks, it ruined my life, and you are heartless about it? Please reach out to wecare@shred.dept.hell.
